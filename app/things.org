*** DONE Allow users to switch tour positions around
CLOSED: [2016-04-07 Thu 22:45]
**** Users can switch but need to hook up backend, there is some code which will get the list order 
out. One way to do this would be to add the listid to the element and then extract that on the 
re-order. This can then be sent to the backend via flux and then reget the locations to update
the ordering. Should only re-order after clicking a confirm button
